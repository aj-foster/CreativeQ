Order Awaits an Advisor's Approval

An order for one the agencies you advise, <%= @order.name %>, is ready for an advisor's approval. Before an order can be printed, launched, or published, it will need final approval from an advisor.

Please ensure the order for <%= @order.organization.name unless @order.organization.nil? %> is approved as soon as possible. If you have any questions, feel free to contact the Communications Coordinator at OSI Creative Services.
