New Comment on Your Order

One of your orders, <%= @order.name %>, has a new comment posted by <%= @comment.user.name unless @comment.user.nil? %>. It reads:

"<%= @comment.message %>"

<% if @comment.has_attachment? %>
It also has a file attachment. If you have any questions, feel free to contact the web folks at OSI Design Group.
<% else %>
If you have any questions, feel free to contact the web folks at OSI Design Group.
