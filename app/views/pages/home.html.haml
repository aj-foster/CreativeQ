						CreativeQ is the work order management system for OSI's Creative Services. Members of OSI Agencies can submit requests for Graphics, Web, and Video work here. If you are a member of an agency and do not yet have an account, you can
						= succeed "." do
							= link_to "apply for one here", new_registration_path(resource_name)
						Once an administrator approves your account, you'll be able to create and manage orders.
					%p Most user accounts are tied to an @ucf.edu e-mail. If you have inherited a student position with such an e-mail, there's probably already an account waiting for you. Ask your Graduate Assistant or Advisor for more information.
